- 👋 Hi, I’m @quantum-corn.
   - I am a physics graduate with an immense interest in computers. I have worked with Python, Java, C, HTML, CSS, PHP. JavaScript, Oracle database, Arduino, gnuplot, MATLAB, etc. I run a Linux Machine. I am the founder of The Bosons, an organization that works to make education avialable and accessible to everyone, and I invented the Wolf Pack learning method. The Bosons offers courses based on this method.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things, whatever that may be.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning physics, and python libraries and Quantum Computing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on The Bosons and also in anything else really. I am very curious, so i'll take an interest in anything where I can learn new things.
