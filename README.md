## Welcome

---

I am a physics graduate from India. The years in college and after left me in a bad place in life, when I decided to become a software developer because I always knew  I love coding as much as I love physics. I believe the two ae not very different. Pure logic and abstraction take up tangible forms in programs and physics is just the art of unraveling the code of the massive codebase that is the universe, one line at a time. Fascinating to think that we ourselves are part of that program. Isn't it like some fascinating AI that writes its own code, keeps learning and keeps getting better. I had some previous programming experiences which only made me want more.
