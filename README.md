# Welcome To My Profile

I am a physics graduate from India. After graduating I decided to become a software developer. I believe coding and physics are not very different. Pure logic and abstraction take up tangible forms in programs and physics is just the art of unraveling the code of the massive codebase that is the universe, one line at a time. Fascinating to think that we, ourselves, are part of that program. Isn't it like some fascinating AI that understands its own code, keeps learning and keeps getting better.
